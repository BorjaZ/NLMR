Description: NLMR aims to be a broad library of neutral landscape models 
  (Gardner et al. 1987 <doi:10.1007/BF02275262>,
  With 1997 <doi:10.1046/j.1523-1739.1997.96210.x>) that can easily extend in 
  existing landscape analyses. Neutral landscape models range from "hard" 
  neutral models (only random functions) to "soft" ones (with parameters) and 
  generate landscape patterns that are not grounded in ecological reasoning.
  Thus, these patterns can be used as null models in landscape ecology. NLMR 
  combines a large number of algorithms from published software (Saura & 
  Martínez 2000   <doi:https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1008107902848>, Etherington et
  al. 2015 <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12308>) for simulating neutral landscapes and
  includes utility functions to classify and combine the landscapes. The 
  simulation results are obtained in a geospatial data format (raster* objects 
  from the raster package by Hijmans (2017) 
  <url:https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster/>) and can, therefore, be used 
  in any sort of raster data operation that is performed with standard 
  observation data.
