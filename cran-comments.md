## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this submission I've fixed:

* Added a reference for neutral landscape models to the 'Description' field
  * And one for the raster package, as we heavily built on it
* Short description of neutral landscape models added to the 'Description' field
* Omitted the redundant "with R" in our title
